= Bloody jQuery Plugins =

A small collection of useful functionality available by default in Dojo, though useful in plain-ole-JavaScript context.

== hitch.js ==

Advanced scope manipulation in jQuery. For jQuery 1.3 and before, as 1.4 the official "way" to accomplish this is via $.proxy ... New versions of this module _may_ curry arguments, giving it an advantage over proxy. The Dojo version currently curries arguments.

== pubsub.js ==

Ambiguous communication plugin. Small API surface. Publish some message to listeners.

== date.js ==

Date functionality for jQuery, living in the $.date namespace. Provides date.add, date.compare, date.difference, and a few other small utility functions. Ignore the word `dojo` in the source. By way of JavaScript _magic_ it is actually a _jQuery_ plugin. I promise.

= License =

Being stolen directly from the Dojo Toolkit source, these plugins are released under a dual AFL/BSD license identical to Dojo proper. See http://dojotoolkit.org/license for more information.
